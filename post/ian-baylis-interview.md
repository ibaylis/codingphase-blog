### Can you introduce yourself (name, location, age, etc..)?

My name is Ian Baylis. I am a 34 years old web dev born and raised in philly. I am a Father of a wonderful little 3 year old, husband to an awesome wife (who is also a programmer) and a Christian that loves to code.

### How did you get interested in programming?

It really started when I was a kid in the early 90s. Our school had this program on it that you could write just a few commands and it would make really intricate designs and patterns...I would sneak off during lunch break or recess to go to the computer lab to code and make these designs (since I was a good student, the teachers would look the other way if i stayed a bit longer). I was always a big gamer...and I loved dragonball z. I would go to all these websites finding pictures of Z characters, print them out and draw them..I would go to the old geocities sites wondering how to build the sites but just didnt have the right direction on how to make my own sites. I always wondered when I played a video game "how did they create them...and how did they fit a whole game in a cartridge" and would sit with my brother and friends dreaming about making my own game. Sadly it wasnt until about 18 when I got the chance to start learning.

### When did you start learning to code?

When I graduated highschool my intention was to go to community college for 2 years and then transfer to a four year for computer science...but my mother didn't like the idea of her child going to community college so I wound up going to Philadelphia University. Since I came from a low income family, I was only able to stay there for 1 semester even with all the loans and grants I had gotten. A few months later I met with a counseler and they introduced me to this program called DMTP - Digital Media Training Program. It was a program that would take inner city youth and teach them tech like music, movie and video production, and web development. Most of the other guys in the class would make mix tapes and music...I was one of the ones that gravitated to the web dev part. Back then I learned html, css, javascript, and actionscript/flash...most people dont even know what flash is today but it was the first real language I learned. After a few months there I went to ITT and enrolled in their Multimedia program and picked up php and jquery.

### Where do you learn new skills?

Its called the google machine lol When I lost my job as a multimedia programmer I realized that I had fallen behind. Everyone was talking about SPAs, Angular, React, and Node...I was still on Actionscript 3 and jquery UI (this was in 2017). I was thankful I picked up wordpress because I was still a little relevant and was able to pick up a few jobs but I knew I needed to skill up. First I went to teamtreehouse and stayed on there for a while. I then went to lynda.com, pluralsite, udemy, and codingphase.com. I currently bounce between Codingphase, Udemy, and Youtube. I like Udemy because you can get a course that would cost thousands in person for a sick price. Why would you pay 5 grand for something you can get for 10 bucks...Plus many of the good teachers taught bootcamps. I like youtube because you can get a quick tutiorial on something you need right away. Lets say your company needs a project done in Vue. You can take a weekend, go on youtube, and cram the latest Vue vids and come in on Monday with enough knowledge to be useful on the project. Its crazy when ou think about it. Before you had to go to school to pick up a language, now for the price of a good internet connection, you can learn what you want. I love codingphase because it is really geared towards getting jr devs jobs. I actually got interviews and a web dev job back in 2018 because of the React Real Estate App. I wish that these sites were around in that capacity when I was younger...I'd be killing it right now. Most people dont realize the amount of access they have. They worry about whether the field is being automated while working at a dead end job...it amazes me.

### What do you love the most about programming?

I love the possiblities...I can code all day because it feels as though I can create anything given enough time. Web Dev specifically is one of the few fields that you can get into quick and make as much as a Doctor or Lawyer as long as you put in the work. If you have no job...You can devote 8hrs a day 7 days a week to coding and get a job between 3 to 6 maybe 8 months for between 40k to 60k as a junior dev of some kind...or a content editor...or wordpress dev. Programming is hard and there is a lot to learn...but so is working overnight at a deadend job or a warehouse for \$15 an hr...to get good we have to tackle hard things...pick your hard. Just make sure the hard you pick is a profitable and reqarding one.

### What do you hate about programming?

I think that there are just so many languages to pick up today...too many to choose from and so little time to learn them all. I regrete not learning Javascript deeply in my early 20's and got a job as a js dev then...it was such a simplier time. All you needed to know was HTML, CSS, and maybe javascript...alot of sites were built in flash and actionscript back then though.

### Are you currently working as a developer?

Yes I am working as a web developer at a medical components company. Their current stack is evolving but is currently html, css, javascript, php, mysql, and wordpress. For all the young devs, do not sleep on wordpress..it could be our ticket in.

### What's your favorite stack or type of applications?

My favorite stack is the MERN Stack. It was the first of the newer stacks that clicked with me. I dont mind Angular or Vue, and I do have respect for php, but it was React that brought me into the newer age of programming from jQuery and actionscript.

### What's a technology or language or skill you wish to learn in the future?

I want to get better at algorithms and datastructures and have a deeper understanding of Javascript as a whole. I also want to learn how to be a better entreprenure and start a Web Dev company so I can leave a legacy to my children

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In 5 years I see myself working from home for my own business or remote as a Senior Developer or both

### If you were to go back into time and give yourself an advice to make it easier to learn to code what would you say?

I would tell my past self to learn javascript deeply over actionscript and to code everyday. Before I got married and had kids I was an avid gamer and yugioh player. I wasted thousands of hours playing. Now, it is ok to have free time and hobbies but If I prioritiezed coding, I would be alot further along now. I would also tell my past self to hustle and learn wordpress earlier so you can get jobs faster and wouldnt have to rely on companies for a paycheck. I would also tell myself to not stress so much...that as long as you do the work, you can achieve your dreams.
